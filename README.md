# predictive-modelling-HR-data

Human Resources are critical resources of any organiazation. Organizations spend huge amount of time and money to hire 
and nuture their employees. It is a huge loss for companies if employees leave, especially the key resources. 
So if HR can predict weather employees are at risk for leaving the company, it will allow them to identify the attrition 
risks and help understand and provie necessary support to retain those employees or do preventive hiring to minimize the 
impact to the orgranization.

THis is an end to end data science project. Exploratory analysis has been done. Hyothesis testing and some key observations has been established. Later on different predicitve modelling has been done using various algoithms such as Logisitc regression, decision tree, bagging classifier, random forest classifier, Ada boosting, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Niave Bayes
